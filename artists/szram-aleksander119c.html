	<p>Aleksander is particularly interested in the performance of contemporary repertoire and has given world premières of works by Frederic Rzewski, Daryl Runswick, Dai Fujikura, Harris Kittos, Anthony Green, Danny Ledesma, Bushra El-Turk and Hao Weiya among others, leading to the release of his debut CD for the German label Fonorum.  Solo programmes have included the complete Tippett Piano Sonatas and several works by Sorabji, Alkan and Ives. Aleksander has performed at the major UK venues, and for many concert societies, including collaborations with Philip Fowke, Alexander Ivashkin, Wissam Boustany, Ian Pace, Lorna McGhee and Paul Edmund-Davies, and concertos with Jan Latham-Koenig, Peter Stark and Andrew Morley. He has also accompanied masterclasses given by Maxim Vengerov, James Galway, Elly Ameling and Robert Cohen among others. He is one of few pianists who regularly accompanies from memory. With his group, The Lycydas Piano Trio, he gave the UK premiere of the Piano Trio in A minor by Sibelius, and worked with Roger Smalley, receiving an honorary award in 2003 from the Peter the Great Festival in Gröningen, Holland. Aleksander is an enthusiastic composer, having studied with John Ashton Thomas, Francis Pott and William Benjamin, and also electronic composition with Keith Hamel. Aleksander recently completed his <span class="caps">DMA</span> on a full scholarship at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, where he studied piano with Jane Coop, and harpsichord and organ with Doreen Oke. His doctoral thesis constituted a guide to the performance of Cornelius Cardew&#8217;s Octet &#8217;61 on the piano. He now lectures in Performance Practice at Trinity College of Music, London, and has also guest-lectured at the Royal Academy of Music and at York University. Later this year he will be recording the Scafra Preludes by Daryl Runswick under the supervision of the composer, and the Rzewski Piano Trio with the Lycydas Trio. In 2009 he will be performing for the first time in Greece, South Africa and Colombia.</p>
